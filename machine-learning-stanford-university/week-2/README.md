## Week-2 submissions
I have implemented linear regression in octave / MATLAB and have used the gradient descent algorithm and normal equation to find the parameters <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\theta" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\theta" title="\theta" /></a>.
Instead of using for loops, have used vectorization techniques because it utilises parallelization on newer architecture processors and I personally prefer writing that code
directly in the form in which I would have mathematically.
