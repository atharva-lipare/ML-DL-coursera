## Week-2 submissions
I have implemented linear regression in octave / MATLAB and have used the gradient descent algorithm and normal equation to find $\theta$.
Instead of using for loops, have used vectorization techniques because it utilises parallelization on newer architecture processors and I personally prefer writing that code
directly in the form in which I would have mathematically.
